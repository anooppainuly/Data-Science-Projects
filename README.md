## Pre-Profiling & Pre-processing

 - Joining the 2 Datasets to form a consolidated dataset.
 - Drop redundant columns like 'date', 'umpire1', 'umpire2', 'umpire3 etc.

### Observations & Actions:

 - Missing Values in the ‘City’
 - All the missing city column has 'Dubai International Cricket Stadium' as venue
 - Replace those city values by ‘Dubai’

## Conclusion or Summarization

 - It is analyzed that the when it comes to most match winning
   performances then Chris Gayle tops the chart as he has received the
   Man of the Match Award maximum number of times, followed by AB de
   Villiers and Rohit Sharma. This simply means that when it comes to
   winning the matches these players make the maximum impact and are
   most sought-after players in the bidding process
 - In the department of batting, overall best performers have been   
   Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma as their overall batting  
   stats(runs, average, and strike rate) are balanced and at the top as 
   well.
 - In the department of bowling, SL Malinga stands ahead from all other 
   bowlers as his stats speak for his overall performance in the IPL. He
   is the leading wicket taker, along with the best strike rate and   
   average. In the economy front also he is at overall no 3. The other  
   bowlers who have also been very impactful in the IPL are Amit Mishra 
   and PP Chawla.
 - Top catcher of the IPL has been KD Karthik, followed by SK Raina, so 
   they also play an important role in their team's success in the IPL.

## Actionable Insights

 - Franchise must make sure that they manage to get Chris Gayle, Virat  
   Kohli and Rohit Sharma if they need to increase their winning   
   chances.
 - To strengthen the batting of the team Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli and  
   Rohit Sharma must be included in the teams. Suresh Raina and Rohit   
   Sharma belong to Chennai SuperKings and Mumbai Indians Respectively  
   who are 2 top teams in IPL so far.
 - To strengthen the bowling of the team SL Malinga should definitely be
   considered. No Doubt why Mumbai Indians is the team with maximum no  
   of titles under their name.
